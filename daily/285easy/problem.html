<p>We will make a binary byte oriented encoding of data that is self describing and extensible, and aims to solve the following problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>portability between 32 and 64 (and any other) bit systems, and languages, and endian-ness.</li>
<li>type system independent of underlying language.<br />
</li>
<li>Allow heterogeneous arrays (differing types of array elements) where the underlying language has poor support for them.</li>
<li>leverage power of homogeneous arrays in a language.</li>
<li>support records regardless of underlying language (array of records is homogeneous, even though a record is a heterogeneous list of fields)</li>
<li>Allow ragged arrays (a table where each row is a list, but the rows do not have a uniform size (or shape))</li>
<li>Provide basic in memory compression. Allow deferred decoding of partial data.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="extendible-byte-base.">2. Extendible byte base.</h1>
<p>Any size integer can be coded into a variable byte array by using the maximum byte value as a marker to add the next byte value to decode the total.</p>
<p>This is useful for coding numbers that you think can be limited to around 255 or close to it, without being &quot;hard constrained&quot; by that limit. &quot;256 possible op codes (or characters) ought to be enough for everyone forever thinking&quot;</p>

<p>every element that is not 255 marks the end of &quot;that integer&quot; in a list. You should also write a decoder that transforms output into input.</p>
<h1 id="multibyte-and-variable-byte-encodings">3. multibyte and variable byte encodings</h1>
<p>Instead of a single byte target encoding, 2,4,8 and variable defined byte sizes are also desirable to cover integers with larger ranges. An account balance might have a 40 bit practical limit, but you might not guarantee it forever. 64 bits might not be enough for Zimbabwe currency balances for example.</p>
<p>For compressing a list of numbers, often it is useful to set the whole list to one &quot;byte size&quot;. Other choices include,</p>
<ul>
<li>setting an enum/table of possible byte size codings of 1 2 4 8 sizes, and then encoding, the number of elements, the table/enum size and definition, and then 2 lists (enum key, data items)</li>
<li>interleave bytesize, data</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter will often be longer for long lists, but does not encode the table so is simpler to encode/decode.</p>
<p><strong>Encoding format for table definition:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>4 bytes: first 30 bits - length of list. last 2 bits: key into 1 2 4 8. If first 30 bits are max value, then following 4 bytes are added to count until a non-max value is taken. Similar to challenge #2.<br />
</li>
<li>list of byte lengths defined by key in 1. If last 2 bits of 1 are 3 (signifies up to 8 distinct integer sizes), then this list has 8 items. If there only 6 distinct integer size codings, then the last 2 items in this list would be ignored and set to 0. Values over 255 are encoded as in challenge 2.</li>
<li>list of ordered data encodings in boolean form, if there are more than 1. 1 bit for 2, 2 bits for 4, 3 bits for 8.</li>
<li>list of data elements.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>challenges</strong><br />
encode list of integers from 0 to 1025 using 8 or 16 bit variable encoding. With the shortest encoding that will contain the number. Just print the sum of all the bytes as result for output brevity.</p>
<p><strong>solution</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>first 4 bytes are (1025 * 4) + 1 (leading 0 bytes for smaller than &quot;full size&quot; numbers)</li>
<li>2 byte list: 1 2</li>
<li>0 for first 256 bits, 1 for remaining bits (total 1032 bits long with padding)</li>
<li>256 + (769 * 2) bytes long encoding of the numbers.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="balanced-signed-numbers">4. balanced signed numbers</h1>
<p>Some numbers are negative. The common computer encoding for signed number ranges is to subtract half the max power of 2 from the value. A signed byte has range -128 to 127, where a 0 value corresponds to -128 (in our encoding).</p>
<p>For numbers outside this range encoded in a single byte, the process is to take the first byte to determine the sign, and then following bytes add or subtract up to 255 per byte until a non 255 value is reached.</p>
<h1 id="unbalanced-signed-numbers">5. unbalanced signed numbers</h1>
<p>Instead of the midpoint marking 0, a byte can encode a value within any defined range. Another important application is to use &quot;negative&quot; numbers as codes of some sort. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An expectation that negative numbers are less frequent and smaller relative to 0</li>
<li>coding special values such as null, infinity, undeterminable (0/0)</li>
<li>Using codes to hint at extended byte encodings and sign of the number, or even data type</li>
</ul>

Negative 2 bytes<br />

Negative custom byte length (value is encoded into 2 numbers. First is byte length (in 255 terminated bytes, followed by that number of bytes to represent the number)</p>
<p>Positive 1 byte (first number indicates range of 468 to 723). 467 could have been encoded as 255 254 without this special code.</p>
